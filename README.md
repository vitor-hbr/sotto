# Sotto

## Linux-native fork

This fork adds a **GTK 4 client for Ubuntu/GNOME on Wayland**, using the existing
Linux Whisper/llama.cpp server. Start and stop recording with a desktop shortcut,
review the transcript, then copy and paste it into your application.

**[Linux installation and usage →](Linux/README.md)**

The client is an initial implementation: explicit clipboard delivery, a toggle
shortcut, and the default microphone. Automatic insertion, hold-to-talk, shared
preferences editing, and a history browser are not implemented in the Linux UI.
The original macOS client remains available below.

## Original macOS client

Hold a key, speak, and release to insert your dictation. Sotto is a native macOS app backed by a model server running on the same Mac, another Mac, or Linux. Audio uploads while you speak; the server returns progress and one finished transcript.

The dev runner builds **Sotto Dev**, with separate settings and visible Dev labels. For the regular app, run `./scripts/build-app.sh` and install `build/Sotto.app` in Applications. Both connect to an independently running server.

## Get started on one Mac

You need Apple Silicon, macOS 14+, full Xcode 26+ with the Metal compiler, CMake, and Git. Xcode provides Swift; the build requires Swift 6.2+. Python 3 is only needed for the test scripts.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/davis7dotsh/sotto.git
cd sotto
```

[Download the pinned Whisper and Qwen models](Server/README.md#models) into `.local/models`, then build and start:

```sh
export SOTTO_SPEECH_MODEL="$PWD/.local/models/ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin"
export SOTTO_TEXT_MODEL="$PWD/.local/models/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-MLX-4bit"
./scripts/run-dev.sh
```

Use your own model paths if they are already installed. The script builds the server and client, starts **http://localhost:8391**, and opens `build/Sotto Dev.app`. The first build fetches dependencies and the small Silero speech detector.

1. Grant **Sotto Dev** Microphone and Accessibility permissions.
2. Wait for the server to be ready. Focus a text field, hold **Right Option**, speak, and release.
3. Change the shortcut under **This Mac**, choose inputs under **Microphone**, and edit shared cleanup instructions or dictionary entries under **Server preferences**.

**Test microphone** shows a result in Sotto without inserting it. Fn/Globe is also supported; set macOS **Keyboard → Press Globe key to → Do Nothing** if its system action conflicts.

## Use a server on another machine

Follow the [server guide](Server/README.md) for macOS, Linux, or containers. On the client Mac, build and open only the app:

```sh
./scripts/build-app.sh
open "build/Sotto.app"
```

Set its URL and token under **This Mac**. Use HTTPS for remote hosts, or HTTP with the server's literal Tailscale IP on your connected tailnet. The client needs no model weights or GPU for inference.

## Daily development

```sh
./scripts/run-dev.sh start --skip-build   # Start existing builds
./scripts/run-dev.sh status
./scripts/run-dev.sh stop
./scripts/run-dev.sh restart             # Rebuild and restart the server
swift test
./scripts/smoke-test.sh                  # Real HTTP/audio test; server must be idle
./scripts/test-corrections.sh            # Real Qwen helper checks
```

Keep the model-path exports set when starting the server or running helper checks. After rebuilding an already-open client, quit and reopen it to load the new executable. Signing uses an available Apple Development identity or ad-hoc signing; ad-hoc rebuilds may require granting permissions again.

The dev runner stores shared history/settings in `.local/server`, device preferences in `.local/client`, and logs in `.local/server.log`. Keep experiment notes and generated artifacts under the ignored `.local/` directory too. Quitting the app leaves the server running. Recordings require an online, available server and have a three-minute limit.

All connected Macs share history, tagged by device. Both original and inference audio are kept by default; **Keep original microphone audio** changes original retention for future takes. Back up the server data directory to preserve history.
